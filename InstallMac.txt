Installation on Mac:

Put the folder SCMIRExtensions in your extensions directory. If you need hints on how to do that, see the [Using-Extensions] help file in SuperCollider (also linked in Main Help)

You also need the SCMIRUGens from sc3-plugins (https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins); these also go in your extensions directory.


Compilation: Pre-compiled executables for Mac for Intel and M-series arm chips are now provided here:
composerprogrammer.com/code/scmirexec.zip
Put the executables for your machine type in a folder 'scmirexec' within SCMIRExtensions

You can also compile the executables yourself using CMake.

If you don't have Cmake installed, you can get it from MacPorts, brew etc.

cd /path/to/SCMIR/Source
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES='i386;x86_64' ..
# for M-chip Macs use cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES='arm64' ..
make
make install
